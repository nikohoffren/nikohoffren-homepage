# Niko Hoffrén Homepage - Portfolio

![Niko Hoffrén](https://github.com/nikohoffren/nikohoffren-homepage/blob/main/public/NHlogo.jpg?raw=true)

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website shows all the information you need with showcase of my projects and skills. It also supports language selection, allowing users to switch between Finnish and English languages seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Reflection

I chose to use Vite for this project due to its fast and lean build tool, allowing for a quicker development process. TypeScript was used to provide static type checking, and Tailwind CSS allowed me to style the website easily with low-level utility classes.
